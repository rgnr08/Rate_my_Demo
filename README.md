Rate_my_Demo
============

Sofa King Good ITECH Project

===================================================================

Rate my Demo is a website that has been designed to deliver a unique music sharing platform where artists can submit demos to be listened to and rated by other users.

Key features of the site are the randomised delivery of audio tracks to users which means that users cannot just select and rate music by their favourite artists. This will help reduce bias in the demo ratings as users will only rate a random selection of tracks. There is also a randomiser button that will re-randomise the list of demos that are available to users.

Artists will be able to upload demos, name them and add a thumbnail image for each one via the upload button.  They will also be able to delete any uploaded demos via their demo page.

Each demo can be rated up and down by users and these ratings will be visible to all users. The top five tracks will also be displayed on the home page and the user profile page.

Users will also be able to select favourite tracks which will allow them to listen to them at any time via a favourite page that is accessed from their profile page. Users can also remove favourites at any time via the favourite page.
